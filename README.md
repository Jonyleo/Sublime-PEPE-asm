# Sublime-PEPE-asm
Syntax highlighting package for Sublime Text 3 using the YAML format
This version isn't present in Package Control therefore it needs a manual instalation (very simple)


Features
---------
* Syntax highlighting according to PEPE's Manual
* Extra hidden instructions also covered

Requirements
---------
* Sublime Text - http://www.sublimetext.com
* git - https://git-scm.com/download for windows (if you have linux you probably know about git already)

Installing
---------
* Open Sublime Text, on the top bar select Preferences > Browse Packages...
* Enter the User Folder by double clicking it
* Clone the repo to this folder, if you installed git with the link presented above do the following:
* Once inside the folder, right click, and select "Git bash here"
* Write the following command on the git cli: git clone https://github.com/Jonyleo/Sublime-PEPE-asm
* If you want to copy & paste, you will have to right click > paste on git cli, ctrl+v does not work

How to Use
---------
* Open Sublime Text 
* Click the bottom right corner of the screen, it will probably say something like "Plain text"
* Look for PEPE asm on the list and click it
* You can also use the option "Open all with current extension as..." then select PEPE asm while having a .asm file open to save this setting for the future

More Info
---------
* Im planning on adding invalid syntax highlighting, still looking into how I can make it optional and also looking for the best way to not have it clutter the workspace
* You can report any issues in the Issues tab on github, please provide a code snippet
* If you have ideas for more tools that could help with PEPE asm development let me know
